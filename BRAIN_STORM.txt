What we see in page, at first load we want to either create new project OR load project
For now lets focus on new project. i see this window as modal or floating window

upon load go to main page

this is what i should see:

1. Resources Tab (like sprites, sounds, objects, rooms, functions, scripts, etc...)
2. Tool bar (For Running game, (file) new project, build project and other stuff)

//// Resources Tab
/// Sprites
lets do sprite composer first, when sprites is right clicked, i can either create a sprite or a folder
adding a folder just creates folder, then in sprite when pressed, itll open a file dialog box
after opening a file dialog box, i can pick png images, when picked, itll load it into a sprite grid floating window
where i should see:

 I. Properties Tab
  -1. Origin
   0. sprite name column field
   1. rows and columns field
   2. width and height field

   5. Speed (Set fps to play the animation)

 II. Sprite Image Grid Panel
   1. Grids (boxes) that selectes individual sprites

 III. Actions
   1. Save (Upon save, itll create a json that contains information of that sprite (x, y, w, h) per each box) (save as that file)
   2. Cancel (Which magically closes the floating window.)

Double clicking the sprite will just open the sprite grid floating window 
again with loaded data (corresponds to whats been clicked)

/// OBJECTS
